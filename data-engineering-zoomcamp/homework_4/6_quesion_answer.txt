Compute the continous percentile of fare_amount partitioning by service_type, year and and month

SELECT service_type, year, month, APPROX_QUANTILES(fare_amount, 100)[OFFSET(95)] AS fare_p95
FROM `de-zoomcamp-448512.nytaxi.fct_taxi_trips_monthly_fare_p95`
GROUP BY service_type, year, month
ORDER BY service_type, year, month;

Now, what are the values of p97, p95, p90 for Green Taxi and Yellow Taxi, in April 2020?

SELECT *
FROM (
SELECT service_type, year, month, 
PERCENTILE_CONT(fare_amount, 0.97) OVER (PARTITION BY service_type, year, month) AS fare_p97,
PERCENTILE_CONT(fare_amount, 0.95) OVER (PARTITION BY service_type, year, month) AS fare_p95,
PERCENTILE_CONT(fare_amount, 0.90) OVER (PARTITION BY service_type, year, month) AS fare_p90,
FROM `de-zoomcamp-448512.nytaxi.fct_taxi_trips_monthly_fare_p95`
WHERE year = '2020'
AND month = '04') AS sub_query
GROUP BY service_type, year, month, fare_p97, fare_p95, fare_p90

answer:
green: {p97: 55.0, p95: 45.0, p90: 26.5}, yellow: {p97: 31.5, p95: 25.5, p90: 19.0}
